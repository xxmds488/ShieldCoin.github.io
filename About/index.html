						<h2 id="Wallets">Wallets</h2>
						<h4 style="color:black">If you are looking for our wallets you can find them <a href="../Wallets" target="_blank">Here</a></h4>
						<h4 style="color:black">Maybe you have noticed that we have different options for you to store your SHIELD coins in. The wallets are each a little different from each other and give some benefits to the others. Some diffrences are obvious but some like the diffrence between the Electrum and QT wallet are a little less known. All of the diffrence between our wallets can be found in the following few paragraphs. If you have any more questions than you can contact us at our <a href="https://twitter.com/SHIELDcurrency" target="_blank">Twitter</a> (More platforms to contact us on can be found <a href="#CU" target="_blank">here</a>)

                            <h3 id="stVSex">Standalone wallets VS Exchange wallets</h3>
                            <p style="font-size:17px">If you go to an exchange like Bittrex or Bitfinex you can see that there is an easy option to keep your different coins stored there and maybe you don't understand why you would use anything else. Well there are some differences between the safety and accessibility between these options. First of all a wallet on an exchange isn't all that bad, there are some positives that for some people outshine the negatives. <br> The positives of using a wallet on an exchange are ofcourse that you don't have to pay the miners fee to send coins to the exchange and back to your wallet when you want to sell your SHIELD. Having all your coins on an exchange also makes it that you can see all your coins and price changes on one page. And when on a low or a high you can quickly sell or buy more SHIELD. <br> Now into the negatives. An exchange could get hacked and exchange don't <u>have to</u> refund your stolen funds. Ofcourse your computer with the standalone wallet could also get hacked. But if <u>you</u> don't do anything wrong you'll be completely safe.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-content">
							<h3 id="ElectWall">Electrum wallets</h3>
							<p style="font-size:17px">Besides the basic wallets SHIELD also have Electrum wallets. Electrum wallets do the same as other wallets, they store your coins, in this case your SHIELD. Electrum wallets are a little different from our standerd wallets as they focus on speed and low resource usage. Electrum wallets are based on <a href="http://docs.electrum.org/en/latest/spv.html" target="_blank">SPV</a> or <a href="http://docs.electrum.org/en/latest/spv.html" target="_blank">Simple Payment Verififacation.</a> SVP verifies transactions without needing to download the entire SHIELD blockchain so its transaction confirmation times can drop by over 50%. So if you want to quickly move SHIELD from and to your standalone wallet an Electrum wallet would be a great choice. If you want to know more about Electrum <a href="http://docs.electrum.org/en/latest/faq.html" target="_blank">Click Here.</a> </p>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-content">
							<h3 id="QtWall">QT wallets</h3>
							<p style="font-size:17px">One of the wallets you see when you want to download a SHIELD wallet is the QT wallet. As we've already said, we don't recommend the QT wallet, but for the people that want to store their coins in a QT wallet, or for those who just want to learn more, we'll still explain the concept.
								The QT wallets are wallets where you have to download the entire SHIELD blockchain so you can confirm transactions. If you want to use a QT wallet you have to download the updated blockchain <b>everytime</b> you want to make a transaction. If you haven't updated the wallet in a while it could take some time to download the entire blockchain and we if you want to use a QT wallet we recommend updating once a week so when you do need to make a transaction you don't have to wait. If you want to quickly pay with your coin and don't want to wait untill it updates you shouldn't use a QT wallet. On PC's with limited storages downloading a coin's blockchain could possibly be hard. Bitcoin has a blockchain that is 157.53 GB. Although SHIELD won't have that large of a blockchain it could still be a concerning factor.</p>

						<h2 id="BuyShield">Buy SHIELD</h2>
						<h4 style="color:black">If you're trying to buy SHIELD you can find a list of exchanges <a href="../Exchanges" target="_blank">here.</a> On any of these exchanges you can safely buy SHIELD or any other coin.</h4>
						<h4 style="color:black">Still want to buy SHIELD but couldn't find your exchange anywhere? Well in the next few paragraphs we will try to explain what you can do to buy SHIELD or how you can help us add SHIELD to your exchange. We'll also try and explain why SHIELD isn't on your exchange yet.</h4>
						<div class="feature-content">
                            <h3 id="WhMyEx">I can't buy SHIELD on my exchange.</h3>
                            <p style="font-size:17px">SHIELD is still a very new coin. We're still contacting a lot of exchanges and are trying to get noticed by others. If the exchange you're currently using isn't on our list it doesn't mean it won't ever be. We recommend checking back in a few days as we are close te getting on some exchanges. Alternatively you could check out one of the other exchanges where XSH is currently lised. Any exchange we have on our list is completely safe and a great place to buy SHIELD.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-content">
                            <h3 id="CoExchanges">What future exchanges is SHIELD coming to?</h3>
                            <p style="font-size:17px">We the SHIELD team are currencly trying very hard to get our coin added to several exchanges. We're currencly talking to the next few exchanges about adding SHIELD.
                              <ul>
                                <li>

                                  The SHIELD team is trying to get in contact with Bittrex and Poloniex.

                                Last, but not least SHIELD is also hoping to get onto the Bitfinex exchange and we think that SHIELD will be added before the end of 2018.
                                </li>

						<h2 id="TRMAP">The SHIELD Roadmap</h2>
						<h4 style="color:black">Here we'll be trying to explain the SHIELD team's process in picking the projects for the roadmap. You can find the SHIELD roadmap <a href="../Roadmap" target="_blank">here.</a> </h4>
						<div class="feature-content">
                            <h3 id="CISC">Can the roadmap still change?</h3>
                            <p style="font-size:17px">Everything currently on the roadmap will be released. There could be some unexpected setbacks to the SHIELD team that could make us run little late, we won't be more than 2 weeks behind our roadmap at any given time. If we do get set back we'll make sure we get back on pace. Any changes will be made public immediately when we make the decision. The SHIELD team is working hard to improve the coin and will not give up.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-content">
                            <h3 id="WNW">Why new wallets?</h3>
                            <p style="font-size:17px">Although the wallets we currently have aren't bad the Electrum wallets are in many ways better and easier to use. Storing SHIELD or any other coin for that matter is easier to do on a Electrum wallet. Although cryptocurrency are a anonymous alternative to normal fiat money, it isn't perfect yet. Using a tor/i2p wallet brings some upgrades to the anonymity of using cryptocurrency. Furthermore you ofcourse want to be able to acces your SHIELD on your phone. </p>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-content">
                            <h3 id="WSMI">Why social-media intergration?</h3>
                            <p style="font-size:17px">Having to use a seprate app to give someone money is a big disconveniece. That's why the SHIELD team is trying to make it possible to make payments on almost any social-media platform or chat system. You'll be able to send your mother some SHIELD for her birthday or even pay your friends back. All on one platform of your choosing.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-content">
                            <h3 id="WPS">Why PoS?</h3>
                            <h4>What is PoS?</h4>
                            <p style="font-size:17px">Proof of Stake or PoS basically means that if you have coins you get a percantage of those coins back. The basic concepts of PoS and the few first implementations have a few problems, like whales that don't sell/buy anymore because they just get more coins from not doing anything with them. This ofcourse we'll be trying to solve.</p>
                            <h4>So why use it?</h4>
                            <p style="font-size:17px">If you know what PoW is you probably also now a few of the problems there are with the system. Fist of all it costs a lot of power to maintain to coin, which costs a lot of money. Having proof of stakes takes away some of the power that big mining facility's have over the coin. It also makes 51% attacks on the coin harder to maintain and often too exspensive to try. With PoS SHIELD won't be controlled by the rich.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="feature-content">
                            <h3 id="WQPs">Why Quantum protection?</h3>
                            <p style="font-size:17px">In the near future Quantum computers will be getting better and better and they will become more available to public. Even if it could be still some years untill the public would be able to use quantum computers it's still important to be quantum proof as nobody wants to lose all their money from day to day. The SHIELD team is fighting this with a quantum proof update released in Q4 of 2018. It will be released with Project SHIELD that will have some upgrades to the coin aswell as make it quantum proof. </p>

						<div class="feature-content">
                            <h3 id="CS">SHIELD Coin Specs</h3>
                            <p class="no-padding">SHIELD will have a total of 660 million coins, this makes paying with small amount of money at a time a little easier but still makes each coin worth enough.</p>
                            <p class="no-padding">SHIELD has a blocktime of 15 seconds, this makes it extremely fast and easy to make payment almost eliminating the confirmation time.</p>
                            <p class="no-padding">The SHIELD RPC port is: 20103. RPC is the port generally used by applications to interact with the SHIELD network and operate your SHIELD node/wallet </p>
                            <p class="no-padding">The shield P2P port is: 21103. P2P is the port used by nodes to connect to the network and allow new nodes to connect to the network</p>

                            <h3 id="MS">Mining SHIELD</h3>
                            <p style="font-size:17px">You can mine SHIELD with multiple algorithms which makes mining easier and better on different platforms. Mining SHIELD currencly is done with PoW and will be for a while but the SHIELD team is working on our PoS, PoS Boo. This update will be released with the Project Boo update that you can expect in Q3 of 2018. Our PoS will make the cost of maintaning the SHIELD blockchain lower and will keep electricity costs lower. PoS will also make the inflation of the coin lower and will give it a better future.</p>
