        <h1>Project Initiate</h1>
        <p>
SHIELD is a project about creating a cryptocurrency that will change the future and raise the bar for other coins. If you want to know more about the project we’ll be talking about it more in the future and you can also always check out the ANN or the about page of our website. We will also be releasing a whitepaper in the future where we will not only talk about the coin in its current state but also go over some future stuff we’ll be releasing.

Project Initiate is about letting people know we exist, and also try to explain to people why we started this project, what it will improve on and how we will be trying to make the coin itself better in the future. In this phase we’ll be just releasing a few basic things, like a basic Linux wallet and a Windows wallet(This will probably be an Electrum wallet as we like those more and like working with them more as well.) We’ll also be creating the genesis block, which will start the blockchain and release both an ANN and some reddit post about the project. We hope to get a small community going so we can talk about future improvements, ways they like the coin at this very moment and stuff we need to fix right away. Over the next few months we will be releasing a lot of updates and will be improving the coin as much as we possibly can. With this will come regular updates. Feedback is always appreciated! We hope that in this phase, which will be gone before we know it, the project can create a name for itself and we can get the ball rolling. Will you join us?</p>

      <div class="col-md-5">
        <h1>Project Enlighten</h1>
        <p>Although we have a lot of nice ideas and a lot of upgrades to the coin coming in the future we can’t just say: “SHIELD is a good coin” and expect people to use SHIELD. We should not only explain our different project but also make people understand what they would really be buying when buying SHIELD. This is why in Project Enlighten we will explain to everyone what SHIELD is how we work and what the future of the coin is going to be like. We hope that if we do this right we won’t have to answer the same questions a thousand times and that we can get a user base that doesn’t only like the coin in the current state but is also excited about what is coming. Project Enlighten will only stretch the surface of what is to become one of the main currencies of at least 2018. We’re planning on releasing updates that will not only shake up our coin but will hopefully also shake up some of the other cryptocurrency in telling them that they will have to step up their game! But all those projects need to be explained, this  will done in Project Enlighten. A more in-depth read would be the whitepaper which is planned to be released somewhere this month (as soon as possible of course but we want to make sure we go over everything important.) Furthermore is Project Enlighten about bringing SHIELD, and cryptocurrency in general to a more mainstream audience. If you want to know more about what we’re planning to do you can’t go wrong with reading all our Medium post but for people who want to know all the math behind something like PoS or the logic or workings behind something like Quantum proofing you should wait for the whitepaper.
 In Project Enlighten we will be going over each individual Project and will be explaining it until you hopefully get the basics of that said project. We hope that after Project Enlighten we have not only explained everything there is to explain but that we have also reached to a broader audience for our project as we expect there to be many people that would be interested in many things we are planning to release but maybe wouldn’t understand what the meaning behind certain words is. Hopefully this will help you understand the world of cryptocurrency./p>

        <h1>Project Billfold</h1>
        <p>SHIELD is a project about giving a community as much as we possibly can. This is why we decided not to do a premine and we try to listen to our audience on our Twitter, ANN or other social media's. But one thing SHIELD is missing is accessibility. Yes we have a few wallets and if you want to, you can build your own for whatever platform you want. Unfortunately some wallets like the Electrum wallet is a bit harder to set up on your own. This is where Project Billfold comes in. There are some major updates coming like PoS and quantum proofing but we still need to give everyone the ability to use their preferred wallet on their preferred OS.



        Pos, quantum proofing and Sharding. This all is coming but to ensure a larger audience for SHIELD we need to bring out something that is essential to any coin, we need to create some official wallets for multiple platforms. This will make SHIELD easier to use, and compatible for more users. Of course anyone could run something like Linux but we would recommend having a wallet for Windows is a lot nicer if you're used to the OS. What is it we'll be releasing? We don't know for sure yet what we'll be able to get done in the time we gave ourselves for the project but we ensure at least one wallet for every big desktop OS. We'll also be contacting some businesses that are wallet related to see what we can do as we understand that some people like using paper wallets or a web wallet. We hope to have everyone covered for the next few months so we can grow into more of a currency then we are right now. While this project is going on we'll also try and get some online stores to partner with us to watch what we can do to make it a valid option for paying with. We hope that when finished we'd be able to plain just leave for the next 6 months, come back and still be a functional currency. This of course we would never do but is just an indication of how much we plan on doing. There will also be some important updates following this one like the Globalize Project which we will be talking about in a few days. Any requests? Contact us via twitter, bitcointalk or any other social media you find us on! </p>

      <div class="col-md-5">
        <h1>Project Globalize</h1>
        <p>SHIELD wants everyone to be able to use it. We are working on getting everything user friendly but that could still take some time. In the meantime we will be trying to make 1. Everything clear with Project Enlighten and 2. Make storage for the coin available to everyone. We already talked about this in the explanation about project Billfold but we want everyone to be able to use their preferred OS with their preferred wallet. We only mentioned desktop OS's for a reason, we are also working on mobile wallets but will do this a little later because this itself is a big project.



What will Project Globalize bring to the table? We'll try and get a wallet out for every big mobile OS, iOS and Android mainly. We are also trying to work on different wallets for every platform as just an android wallet could be difficult to use for some users. We, the SHIELD team think it's important that users at least have a choice in what they want to use and we'll try and give everyone something as close as an incredible wallet as we can. There are some already existing wallets for android and iOS that you can currently already download on your mobile device. We will also be trying to contact these as we understand that some people like having all their money on one app so they can quickly look at how much all their coin are worth and if they want to buy/sell anything. These apps aren't made by us so any problems with them wouldn't be our fault. If you do unfortunately get some problems while using any third-party wallet tell us as quick as you can so we can warn the community of possible dangers.



When can you expect Project Globalize to be finished? Well while Project Globalize isn't that hard to implement it requires a lot of testing as nobody wants to lose any SHIELD because of faulty programming. It also will be optimized a ton so that you don't have to wait for ages when wanting to quickly check your coin before going to sleep or while working.  </p>

        <h1>Project Au Courant</h1>
        <p>Some things are necasarry to make a brand strong. Not only does a brand need a strong product they also need to have some good marketing. A few things stand out above all other, like a great icon or a great website. Although we like our website and logo's like they are right now, we'll try and make them even more great as we go along, and make our project itself better. Hopeing to get even more people stuck on our website as they admire how we have made it and brought information to them as no other. This ofcourse is how we are going to try and do it. We like our logo but we think that it doesn't have the power as something like Ethereum logo. This is why we're going to create a more powerfull logo aswell as redo some of the website in early 2018. </p>
