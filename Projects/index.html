        <h1>Project Initiate</h1>
        <p>Project Initiate is about starting the SHIELD blockchain and creating a basic wallet for Windows and Linux so that people can start mining. While starting the blockchain we'll also be posting an official ANN and some reddit posts.</p>

        <h1>Project Enlighten</h1>
        <p>Project Enlighten is about telling people who we are and what we stand for. We want people to know what we're planning for our coin and what'll be used for. We'll try and explain anything and everything we can about our coin and the future of our coin. We'll also try and make sure that people understand where the coin is going in the future by releasing a page about all the information about all of our projects. We hope to inform people enough to get them exited about our coin as we are planning some big features in the future but will also implement some features into our coin in early 2018. Before releasing the Projects page we'll be informing people on other forums about our future projects so that they don't have to wait for a finished page to read into the SHIELD project. Futurmore is project Enlighten ment to create so trust between the SHIELD team and our community and the Projects page will be for future participants in the SHIELD community who want to know more about the future of the coin and the features we offer.</p>

        <h1>Project Billfold</h1>
        <p>SHIELD already has some amazing features and will have more and more as we go on improving the coin. But still a coin can have as many amazing features as it wants as long as their is no audionce to enjoy the project the coin won't be worth anything. That why you need a big userbase to create a viable coin. For a coin to have a big userbase the coin has to have a multitude of things. The first thing ofcourse is a unique concept. This could be like Dogecoin, while less populair now then in the early days it used to be populair. Why? Well it one of the first of its kind as it brought an idea to the table, cryptocurrencys can be made by anyone. With more and more currencys being created, the standard for coins to get in the top 100 is getting higher and higher. SHIELD already has some nice features and will have many more in the future so we don't have that to worry about. But any succesfull coin also needs to be accessible. At this moment SHIELD doesn't have that many wallets and as you can imagine this could be seen as a huge problem. That's why we are making new wallets for SHIELD. We are going to create a QT asswel as an Electrum wallet for every big desktop OS in project Billfold. We hope to get a bigger userbase with this so the coin can keep growing and growing into something more than just a currency, a lifestyle.</p>

      <div class="col-md-5">
        <h1>Project Globalize</h1>
        <p>As we have mentioned in one of our previous aricles, we will be creating new wallets for SHIELD so that it can be used on desktop. But as we have not mentioned before there still would be something missing if we just left it at that wouldn't we? Yes we have wallets for desktop and everyone with Windows or Linux closeby can store their wallets there. You could just say that people should store their coins on their laptop. This could be usefull, going on a trip with well just take your latop with you and you can buy or sell your SHIELD, or even burn it if you so wish to whenever you want. Yeah this has one ovious problem, people who don't have a laptop can't excass their coins when they are gone. If they want to buy some new pants well, they can't because they can't acces their SHIELD. As you can imagine this would be a huge problem for any coin that want to be used on a regular basis. Thats why we want to bring wallets to your pocket, litterely. We are going to release some android, and possibly iOS wallets so that everyone has the possiblity to acces their SHIELD at any time. We'll also contact some wallets app and try to get added to their service to people that use something like Coinomi can see all their coins in one go. Even their SHIELD. </p>

        <h1>Project Au Courant</h1>
        <p>Some things are necasarry to make a brand strong. Not only does a brand need a strong product they also need to have some good marketing. A few things stand out above all other, like a great icon or a great website. Although we like our website and logo's like they are right now, we'll try and make them even more great as we go along, and make our project itself better. Hopeing to get even more people stuck on our website as they admire how we have made it and brought information to them as no other. This ofcourse is how we are going to try and do it. We like our logo but we think that it doesn't have the power as something like Ethereum logo. This is why we're going to create a more powerfull logo aswell as redo some of the website in early 2018. </p>
